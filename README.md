# SortingAlgorithms

SortingAlgorithms is a project that provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms. It allows users to understand how each algorithm works through animations and compare their performance based on execution time.

## Features

- **Visual Demonstrations**: Step-by-step visualizations of popular sorting algorithms.
- **Supported Algorithms**:
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Bubble Sort

- **Performance Comparison**:
  - Measure and display the time each algorithm takes to sort a given dataset.
  - Compare the execution times of different algorithms.

## How It Works
1. Choose a sorting algorithm from the available options.
2. Input or generate a dataset to sort.
3. Watch the algorithm process the data through a visual animation.
4. View the time taken to sort the dataset.
5. Optionally, compare the results with other algorithms.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iden-a/SortingAlgorithms.git
   cd SortingAlgorithms
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Select a dataset size, content is generated randomly.
2. Pick one or more sorting algorithms to visualize.
3. Start the sorting process and observe the visual animation.
4. View the runtime metrics for each algorithm.
5. Compare and analyze the results.

## Roadmap
- Add support for additional sorting algorithms.
- Include more customizable options for datasets (e.g., input ranges, predefined datasets).
- Enhance visualizations with better animations and interactivity.

## Contributing
